According to the swap counts and sort counts for each of the sorts, selection sort always have the least amounts of swap but most likely to have the most comparisons compared to the other sorts. For selection sort, we constantly look for a number smaller than the one we are comparing, while also minimizing the min index. This results in a fixed number of comparison depending on the array length but also the least amount of swaps since you are not constantly moving back and forth between indexes close by over and over again. For the swaps for bubble sort and insertion sort, their swaps are almost similar in the tests but seems that insertion does more sorts than bubble. With comparisons, bubble sort does way more comparisons than insertion. Bubble and insertion sort are similar in their tests in their swaps and also involves overtime to moving the correct number to their place which is why the swaps are dramatic compared to selection sort.
